# ptime

This script collects all the HTML files in the workpiece cutting time.

### Note

Trutops produces html files when the laser NC program is created.

With this small utility, it lists the cut time of each workpiece.

### Important

First check the folder write permission.

Use the "test_folder" script.

Please clone first "test_folder" repo, then "ptime" repo.
